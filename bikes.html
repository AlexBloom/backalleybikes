    <h1 class="">Cyclocross Bikes</h1>
    <p class="h4">Cyclocross racing is a weird kind of racing for folks that like to carry road bikes through the woods.  Even though most folks who get on a bike will probably never intend to carry it through the woods, Cyclocross Bikes still make great bikes for lots of riders. </p>
    <p class="h4">Because of the unique demands placed on bikes in cyclocross racing, these bikes are built for speed and strength; they’re fast and fun, but not fragile.  Many even come with fittings for racks and fenders and can be put into service as light touring bikes or heavy duty commuters.</p>
    <p class="h4">If you want one bike for many uses, then you should consider a Cyclocross Bike.</p>

    <h1 class="">Mountain Bikes</h1>
    <p class="h4"> Across every face of the hillside on which our towns are perched, there is an ever-expanding network of trails running through the woods.  Sculpted ribbons of earth, stone, and wood have been carved into the landscape like a dirt roller coaster that you can ride anytime, for free! Once you have the right bike, of course.</p>
    <p class="h4">Bikes that are built for singletrack use feature wide tires for maximum off-road traction as well as powerful brakes, a wide range of gears, and (usually) some form of suspension.</p>

        <p>The crown jewel of the expansive Kona line, the Process is the proverbial silver bullet: fast, fun, and durable.  With loads of praise heaped on this bike since it’s original release in 2014, there’s little to be said that hasn’t already been said a thousand times over:</p>
