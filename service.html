<h3 class="m-h2  caps lh-solid section-tagline">The answers you seek begin with a visit.</h3>
<p class="h4">Because we want to keep your bike under you and out of the shop as much as possible, service appointments are available, but in order to ensure availability of parts and sufficient time to complete all of our scheduled repairs, appointments must be made <em> <strong>in person and with the bicycle</strong></em>.  Diagnosis and service scheduling are available on a walk-in basis, so feel free to drop by with your bike anytime!</p>
